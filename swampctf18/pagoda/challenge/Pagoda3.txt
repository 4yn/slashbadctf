This pagoda is yet again unlike the others.
Its walls are rimmed with high-set windows, no doubt to
illuminate the statue found in the middle of the floor.
Google translate helps me identify the inscription in Mandarin
kanji on the statue's base, "He who devised the eight trigrams."
I suppose I have him to thank for all this work.
But what message do the symbols on these walls communicate?
It doesn't seem to work just right.
