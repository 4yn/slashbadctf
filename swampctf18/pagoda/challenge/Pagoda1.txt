It's somewhat dark in here, but the walls (unbroken except for the door by
which I entered) encircle an area no more than eight feet in diameter.
It's horribly dank and dusty--no one can have been in here for years.
Is that an open envelope over there on the floor?
It seems there is a letter inside. Thank heavens it's in English.

   Susanna:

   I've been here for days, mystified by the writings on the walls of
   these pagodas. I have no idea what purpose they serve for these
   temples, shrines, whatever they may be. What I do know is that
   they have inspired me to create a series of sculptures for you.
   They have shone like a Beacon in the night. I have a clear Image
   of what I must now undertake.

   -- Walter De Maria
