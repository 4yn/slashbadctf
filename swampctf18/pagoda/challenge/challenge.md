# Pagoda 1 (499)

Thank Bog I've finally gotten to somplace that has a recognizable structure. After walking for days through this mire and muck, I'm happy to find a hummock. But what is this building, some kind of Asian pagoda? What waits inside for me?

# Pagoda 2 (500)

After having decoded the symbol sequence of the first Pagoda I feel like I'm ready for any new challenge that might be thrust upon me. But wait, what's this I seen in Pagoda 2?

I approach the final pagoda with renewed confidence.

Not broken but, *Hint:* these problems must be solved in Sequence. Consult flag 2 to get it right.
